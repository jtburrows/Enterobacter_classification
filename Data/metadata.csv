With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.",collected_by:DSMZ,2.0,382,,

Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

The infection spanned about 10 months, from the onset of the infection to the death of the patient. During that time, the infection evolved resistance to the multiple antibiotics used to treat it, including the very important class of carbapenems. Bacterial isolates with progressively higher levels of resistance were drawn from the patient at different time points. Later, these isolates were sequenced in order to identify the genetic determinants of the resistance. While all the isolates were sequenced on an Illumina platform, the last isolate to be drawn from the patient, called 56, was also sequenced on a PacBio platform.

Culturing efforts coupled with whole genome sequencing of the gastrointestinal bacteria can address key questions that are computationally non-trivial using shotgun metagenomics alone. This comprehensive gut microbiota-derived bacterial genome collection provides the basis to improve the taxonomic classification resolution of metagenomic analysis, and to allow subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments on host physiology and gut colonisation process. To get a broad and comprehensive coverage of the gut microbiota, we cultivated bacterial species from human faecal samples on different selectice agar media and broth. Samples are whole-genome sequenced on Illumina X10 150bp PE. This data is part of a pre-publication release.

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

Much of the clinically relevant antibiotic resistance in these bacteria is driven by genes carried on mobile pieces of DNA called plasmids. A particularly significant resistance mechanism called the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is capable of hydrolyzing all penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems leaving very few therapeutic options for patients infected with blaKPC positive Enterobacteriaeceae. Unfortunately, the tools that we use for tracking of hospital transmission of bacteria do not focus on plasmids but rather the genome of the bacterium which has acquired the plasmid. Our project is to explore the blaKPC plasmid transmission across species in a single institution in Virginia where KPC-producing Gammaproteobacteria are endemic over several years using whole genome sequencing to gain insights into plasmid transmission and evolution of genes of drug resistance.",collected_by:Clinical Microbiology University of Virginia Health System,4.0,93,hormaechei-steigerwaltii-2,

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.",collected_by:DSMZ,3.0,108,hormaechei-oharae,

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

We used fermentation characteristics, biochemical assays and fatty acid profiles for taxonomic analysis of EB-247T, and supplemented this with information derived from sub-genome- and genome- based analysis. Phenotypic and morphological tests revealed that the isolate is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, highly motile and facultatively anaerobic. Whole cell analysis showed that most of the fatty acids, with the exception of C17:0 Cyclo and C16:1ω6c/C16:1ω7c that were present in altered ratios, were typical for the Enterobacter species. We performed whole genome sequencing of EB-247T to perform subgenome-based phylogenetic analysis i.e. 16S rRNA, multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) and whole-genome-based taxonomic analysis. The draft genome of EB-247T was approximately 4.9 Mb in size with a G+C content of 56.0%. The 16S rDNA sequence of EB-247T showed > 97% similarity to all the Enterobacter species, while MLSA clustered EB-247T within Enterobacter but classified it as a separate species. Analysis using in silico DNA-DNA hybridization showed it had less than 70% sequence similarity with other Enterobacter species. The average nucleotide identity of EB-247T exhibited less than 95% sequence similarity to all the compared Enterobacter species supporting it’s a new species. From these results, we conclude that EB-247T possesses sufficient characteristics that are different from known Enterobacter species, and should be considered to be a novel species. The name Enterobacter bugandensis sp. nov. is proposed for isolate EB-247T (=DSM 29888T=NCCB 100573T).",,18.0,495,bugandensis,

Culturing efforts coupled with whole genome sequencing of the gastrointestinal bacteria can address key questions that are computationally non-trivial using shotgun metagenomics alone. This comprehensive gut microbiota-derived bacterial genome collection provides the basis to improve the taxonomic classification resolution of metagenomic analysis, and to allow subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments on host physiology and gut colonisation process. To get a broad and comprehensive coverage of the gut microbiota, we cultivated bacterial species from human faecal samples on different selectice agar media and broth. Samples are whole-genome sequenced on Illumina X10 150bp PE. This data is part of a pre-publication release.

The infection spanned about 10 months, from the onset of the infection to the death of the patient. During that time, the infection evolved resistance to the multiple antibiotics used to treat it, including the very important class of carbapenems. Bacterial isolates with progressively higher levels of resistance were drawn from the patient at different time points. Later, these isolates were sequenced in order to identify the genetic determinants of the resistance. While all the isolates were sequenced on an Illumina platform, the first isolate to be drawn from the patient, called 24, was also sequenced on a PacBio platform. Because both PacBio and Illumina reads were available, the de novo assembly of the reads from 24 yielded a complete ungapped genomic sequence, consisting of a chromosome and three plasmids. The complete genomic sequence of 24 was used as a template for the assembly of the Illumina reads from the other isolates.","collected_by:Robert Wood, MD",6.0,110,hormaechei-steigerwaltii-1,

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

A particularly significant resistance mechanism called the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is capable of hydrolyzing all penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems leaving very few therapeutic options for patients infected with blaKPC positive Enterobacteriaeceae. Unfortunately, the tools that we use for tracking of hospital transmission of bacteria do not focus on plasmids but rather the genome of the bacterium which has acquired the plasmid.

Much of the clinically relevant antibiotic resistance in these bacteria is driven by genes carried on mobile pieces of DNA called plasmids. A particularly significant resistance mechanism called the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is capable of hydrolyzing all penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems leaving very few therapeutic options for patients infected with blaKPC positive Enterobacteriaeceae. Unfortunately, the tools that we use for tracking of hospital transmission of bacteria do not focus on plasmids but rather the genome of the bacterium which has acquired the plasmid. Our project is to explore the blaKPC plasmid transmission across species in a single institution in Virginia where KPC-producing Gammaproteobacteria are endemic over several years using whole genome sequencing to gain insights into plasmid transmission and evolution of genes of drug resistance.",collected_by:Clinical Microbiology University of Virginia Health System,4.0,93,hormaechei-steigerwaltii-2,
